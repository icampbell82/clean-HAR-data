# clean-HAR-data
This is the project for the coursera class Getting and Cleaning Data

The file run_analysis.r must be placed in the working directory along with an unzipped "UCI HAR Dataset" directory downloaded from the site http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The script will read the test and train data (X, y, subjects), extract only those metrics calculated as a mean or standard deviation, and improve the labeling to adhere to the principles of tidy data. Additionally, the script calculates a mean of each of the 66 metrics broken out by subject and activity and saves this information as a text file in the working directory called "MeanActivityData.txt". 

Please refer to the readme and features_info files in the downloaded file for details of the data processing performed by the UCI group. This script extracts data directly from these values so the description of their methods applies. These are the 66 variables (of the 561 collected in the experiment) that run_analysis.r collects.
